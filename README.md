# My very first web page

Welcome!

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to get me using GitHub and GitPod in order to produce a basic webpage made using HTML & CSS. It's the first project I have done using GitHub and GitPod and has been produced by following a tutorial
that makes up part of the Full Stack-Developer course I am doing with Code Institute. 

## Project Rationale

Basically none of this is my own work, it's all been done by following the tutorial (that is the point of the tutorial though, I'm not just a raging plagerist). 
The project has allowed me to usderstand how GitHub & GitPod can be used to develop web pages, as well as allowed me to gain familiarity with the Command Line Interface. 

## Technologies used

As mentioned above, This project has used GitHub and Gitpod. 

## Have you understood it?

Yes! There's a few bits I would like to relook at, or that I'm hoping will become clearer as I get more hands on with using it (particularly as part of the cli). 
But since doing this module, I'm actually feeling a lot more like I'm taking the important parts of the course in. 

## Is this a Good Enough README? 

I don't know. I've done the bits the Challenge told me to do, so I guess? It sounds like it'd be good for it to be a bit more detailed though. BUT! COUNTER ARGUMENT! 
If you're working on an actual project, rather than a tutorial on how to use GitPod then it should **hopefully** be a bit easier to answer some of the questions around the projects purpose etc. 

Also, I accidentally **worked out** how to do bold in that last paragraph. *And italics*. 

RYAN OUT (I've done a lot of blog writing, it's hard to not think of this in a similar way, so sorry if this is too casual)
